A task management/schedule maker application implementing a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. This project is designed to prioritize tasks, estimate completion time, and manage task scheduling in a console-based environment.

Features
Add, View, and Delete Tasks: Manage tasks by adding, listing, and removing them from the schedule.
Sort by Priority: Automatically sort tasks based on priority to ensure the most critical tasks are listed first.
Estimate Time: Keep track of estimated task durations to help with time management.
Project Structure
This project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern:

Model: Task and Schedule classes, which define the structure of individual tasks and the overall task schedule.
Controller: ScheduleController class, which manages the logic and communicates between the model and view.
View: TextView class, which provides a text-based interface for interacting with the task scheduler.
